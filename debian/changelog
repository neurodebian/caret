    for post-squeeze versions.

  * Applied patch for compatibility with GCC 4.4 (Closes: #525789).
    Thanks to Martin Michlmayr.

caret (5.6.1~dfsg.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Clarify copyright statement of the pieces of the Caret sources that have
    been derived from AFNI, after checking with ftp-masters (Closes: #518688).

caret (5.6.1~dfsg.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reverse the order of the build-dependency alternatives on libqt4 and
    libqt4-opengl-dev. The reason is that sbuild currently only considers
    the first alternative (see #403246), and hence the package FTBFS on the
    buildds. The alternative on libqt4-dev 4.3 is kept in the package as it
    allows to easily build backports on etch systems. (Closes: #519270).

caret (5.6.1~dfsg.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patched to build with VTK 5.2 (Closes: #518640).
  * Updated the upstream homepage field. Thanks to Francesco Poli for pointing
    this out.
  * Updated package description and added a reference to it.

caret (5.6.1~dfsg.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version.
  * Added 'DM-Upload-Allowed: yes' to debian/control.
  * Minimized GCC compatibility-related Debian diff. Upstream applied slightly
    modified patch.
  * Fixed LD_LIBRARY_PATH setting in dh_shlibdeps call in debian/rules.

caret (5.6~dfsg.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Do not install link for caret_edit manpage, since the binary is not
    installed by the Debian package.
  * Use minc version 2 instead of old libminc0.
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.0 -- no changes necessary.
  * Several bugfixes (missing headers) for GCC 4.3 compatibility.
   * Adjust build-dependencies to account for the new libqt4-opengl-dev
    package, built by qt4-x11 (from 4.4.0-1 on). Done in a backport-friendly
    way, i.e. alternatively depend on libqt4-dev (>= 4.3) and (<< 4.4.0).
  * Added Yaroslav Halchenko to Uploaders.
  * caret-data is not recommended, but suggested dependency as the package is
    not yet in the Debian archive. Added relevant notes to README.Debian.
  * Converted debian/copyright into a machine readable format.
  * Include the AFNI licensing terms in debian/copyright as pieces of
    caret_uniformize were derived from AFNI.

caret (5.5.2~dfsg.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Version. Build-depends on Qt >= 4.3. Merged most commandline
    tools into 'caret_command'.
  * Package now honours DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS setting 'noopt'.
  * Build with debug symbols by default.
  * Debian packaging does not use upstream Makefile wrapper to qmake anymore,
    as it might hide build-failures. Calling qmake from debian/rules directly
    instead.
  * Simplified Debian diff to minimize conflicts between upstream changes and
    Debian packaging.
  * Set linker flags -Wl,--as-needed and --no-undefined to reduce the number
    of package dependencies and ensure proper internal shared libraries.
  * Do not build 'caret_edit' anymore as it caused problems with the internal
    shared libraries. This should be no problem, as it is a very simple
    editor and all of the 1000 editors in Debian should be able to do what
    'caret_edit' does/did.

caret (5.5~dfsg.1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Michael Hanke ]
  * Initial release. (Closes: #421703)
  * MPEG support is disabled as VTK in Debian does not provide the necessary
    library for patent reasons (see #408552).
  * The package builds internal libraries as shared libs instead of static
    linking to reduce the size of the distributed binaries.
  * A desktop and menu file for Caret5 was added.
  * Caret binaries are called via a wrapper script that sets an appropriate
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the necessary caret-internal libs and some Qt image
    format plugins.
  * Caret depends on the caret-data package that provides tutorials, online
    help and atlas datasets. While these files are part of the binary
    distribution of Caret they are not part of the sources. The Debian
    maintainer packaged them in a separate source package using the binary
    distribution as source (caret-data).

  [ Yaroslav Halchenko ]
  * Uses dh_wraporig to make source tarball DFSG-free
